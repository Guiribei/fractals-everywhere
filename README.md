# fractals-everywhere
My first graphical project at 42sp named fract-ol

In order to run that away from workspaces you should change the flags there on Makefile. The compilation flags would be -Lmlx_linux -lmlx_Linux -L/usr/lib -Imlx_linux -lXext -lX11 -lm -lz


Also you would probably need to donwload the linux version of mlx at https://github.com/42Paris/minilibx-linux
